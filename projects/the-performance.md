The Performance is a 4th wall breaking point and click adventure game, set in a western saloon.  
Many of the controls are intentionally absurd and this game often plays around the player's expectations.

My role in developing this game was as a narrative designer, I wrote all the scenarios and interactions you
can see in the game, and I also composed the music you hear in the saloon.
