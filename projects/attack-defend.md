Attack/Defend is an abstract two player asymmetric card game with a focus on
bluffing mechanics. It is inspired by the living card game Android:Netrunner.

My role on this project is as the sole designer. I designed all of the
gameplay as well as the visual layout of the cards.

The game can be played using tabletop simulator

# Overview:

Attack/Defend is an asymmetric game where one player, the Defender, plans his cards ahead by placing them facedown and advancing them over time, while the other player, the Attacker plays cards right away in order to figure the defender out and ultimately steal all of their points. Each card has a white and black half, the black half with white text is for the defender while the white with black text is for the Attacker. Any time a card is played, the person who reveals the card is also the one who’s side is played. On the back of the card are the numbers 1-4, these denote the level of advancement a card has when it is face down. Simply turn the card so that it shows the current advancement on the top of the card. The goal of the game is to have 5 points. You gain points by advancing score cards as Defender or, when playing Attacker, by flipping over a scorecard defense is trying to advance.

# Setup:

Shuffle the deck and deal 5 cards to each player. Place the deck in between the players so they can both reach it. When discarding cards as will be discussed later place them face down next to the deck. To make sure you don’t mix the two piles up you can turn the discard pile sideways.

# Picking sides: (optional)

To pick sides one player will declare their preference and the other player can either accept their opponents decision or they can wager cards in their hand to get the side they want. When wagering, the person who discarded the most cards or discarded the same number but first gets the side of their choice. All cards wagered regardless of winning the bet stay face down in the discard pile.

# Playing as the Defender:

The defender always takes the first turn. To begin, draw a card from either the discard pile or the deck. You then have two actions to use from a number of different options:

* Draw a card from the deck or discard
* Place a card face down
* Advance a face down card
* Discard a card

Once a card has advancement equal to or greater than the number printed on the card you may play it at any time (even the opponent’s turn) by flipping it over, this does not cost an action. When a card has been played by being flipped over by you or the opponent it goes to the trash, a pile of face up cards on the other side of the deck from the discard. If you score a point or are forced to score a -1 place that card in a pile with your other score cards, this keeps track of how many points you have total.

# Playing as the Attacker:

The Attacker will go second and draw from either the discard pile or the deck. You then have two actions to use from a number of different options:

* Draw a card from the deck or discard
* Play a card from your hand (so long as it does not have a cost)
* Flip over one of the Defender’s face down cards
* Discard a card

The Attacker can’t score any points on their own, the ways to score are as follows:

* Flipping over a scorecard with enough advancement to score it for yourself
* Using a card to steal from the Defender’s hand and scoring it right away
* Using a card to place a score card from your hand to the field and then flipping it

Since you cannot place any cards yourself, you must rely on feeling out what your opponent is doing and responding accordingly. If you flip a face down card and the white side of the card has two texts, use whichever one has the highest advancement and if the advancement requirement isn’t met use the first text. After a card is played from your hand place it in the trash, a pile of face up cards on the other side of the deck from the discard. 

Warning! If you still hold any score cards (+1 or +2) in your hand by the end of your turn, they are immediately scored by the defense. Make sure you discard them before your turn ends.

# Winning:

A player wins by either having 5 points or by having the most points by the time the deck runs out. If there is a tie, play through the discard as well until a new point is scored.

Have fun and keep in mind that it may take a few rounds to really get the hang of it.
