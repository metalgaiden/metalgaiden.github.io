Attack/Defend is an abstract two player asymmetric card game with a focus on
bluffing mechanics. It is inspired by the living card game Android:Netrunner.

My role on this project is as the sole designer. I designed all of the
gameplay as well as the visual layout of the cards.

The game can be played using tabletop simulator
