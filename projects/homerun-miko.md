Homerun Miko is an isometric action puzzle game about Japanese spirits and baseball.
It was created as part of my senior capstone project at UCSC and involved a team of 
10 people and a 6 month developement cycle.

My role on this project was as lead designer. I designed and iterated on the gamplay
interactions as well as designing all the puzzles. I also composed all the music for 
this game.
