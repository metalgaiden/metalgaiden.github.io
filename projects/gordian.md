Gordian is a small puzzle game about tying even smaller knots. The puzzles take inspiration from The Witness and Opus Magnum.

The goal of this game is to help players contextualize what knots are and reduce them to their most essential form. It's also quite fun to boot.

I just finished making this demo, so I don't have a ton to write yet. To make up for it I have pictures of my ui design diagrams as well as a detailed account of my knot detection algorithm: [MUNCK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12isSWXShy_WF7h9Zc-I2DHJOmNN-t_tfV2iYJuIETSs/edit?usp=sharing)
