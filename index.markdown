<h2> About me: </h2>
Hi, I’m Eli and I’m a game developer with skills in programming, design, music and sound. I have a strong desire to work on projects that challenge me to think creatively and utilize my diverse skill set.

Below are my game projects. Click on them to read a detailed breakdown of the work I did on each one.

While working as a game developer, I developed strong problem-solving skills and the ability to create engaging and unique puzzle systems. My game, [Gordian](/projects/gordian), showcases these skills and demonstrates my ability to work on every aspect of game development.

I also have experience in action game design, as shown in my project [Choke Slam](/projects/choke-slam), a one on one fighting game built in the Godot engine. I enjoyed the challenge of refining and implementing fighting game mechanics to create a deep and enjoyable gameplay experience.

In my project [Homerun Miko](/projects/homerun-miko), developed in Unity as my senior capstone project at UC Santa Cruz, I displayed my puzzle design skills, creating unique and challenging puzzles with satisfying "aha!" moments.
