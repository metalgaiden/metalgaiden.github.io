<h2> About me: </h2>
Hi, I’m Eli and I’m a game designer with skills in programming, design, music and sound. My goal is to make games that are as unique as they are interesting. Games are more interesting when they have vision and voice behind them, so I hope to work on games that I’m uniquely situated to make.

Below are my game projects, click on them to read a detailed breakdown of the work I did on each one.

<br/>

## Games:

My most recent work, which displays my ability to solve complex problems and also make interesting and engaging puzzle systems, is [Gordian](/projects/gordian). It's a game about tying knots and I did the programming, design, sound effects and music. It shows what a generalist can do when touching every piece of the game making pie. I'm really proud of how I brought this one together. Try it out. You'll be impressed.

If you want to see my work on action games I would take a look at [Choke Slam](/projects/choke-slam). It’s a one on one fighting game made in the Godot engine, designed and programmed by me. While it may look simple on the surface, dialing in fighting game mechanics to have both depth and game feel is quite the challenge. It requires a second player, but it's well worth grabbing one. You'll find it's quite fun and has a good amount of depth for it's constrained rule set.

If you’d like to see more of my puzzle design work, check out [Homerun Miko](/projects/homerun-miko). It was built in Unity for my senior capstone project at UC Santa Cruz. You’ll find the puzzles interesting and unique, with plenty of “aha!” moments to be had.
