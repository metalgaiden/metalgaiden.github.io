<h2> About me: </h2>
I am a game designer and programmer with a B.S. in Computer Science: Game Design at University of California Santa Cruz. I like video games of course, but also rock climbing, martial arts (judo, bjj), and tinkering with old electronics.

I try to play a wide variety of games across different genres to better understand what makes a game engaging and worth playing. My favorite games are fighting games, but I also play rogue-likes/lites, role playing games, platformers, puzzle games, tabletop games, really anything that delivers a quality gaming experience.

## What I'm looking for:
I’m interested in working on games that meaningfully push gaming forward as a medium, which can mean a number of things to different people. So let me be a little more specific.

I tend to think of there being two main ways a game can push the innovative boundaries. The first is to add elements into games that have not been there before. This approach takes elements from other disciplines or personal experience and injects them into a game, pulling non-gaming elements into the gaming experience. An example of this is Disco Elysium, which takes elements from politics, philosophy and psychology in addition to it’s more conventional RPG roots.

A subset of these kinds of games are one’s that pull directly from other games, but recombine the base elements into something new. Noita does a great job of this kind of remixing, taking pieces from older simulation games like powder-toy and combining them with the core loop of a modern rogue-lite.

The second approach is to explore the internal mechanics of the game space itself, presenting a direct and authentic dialog within the current constraints of the medium and technology. Games like The Witness or Undertale do a great job of setting up this dialog, asking the player to understand the games on a more fundamental level and in so doing providing additional texture directly from the medium itself.

I am currently seeking opportunities to contribute some of what I have learned to an active gaming project. If you know of any such projects, please get in touch. My linkedin, github and email are linked below and my resume can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).
