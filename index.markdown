<h2> About me: </h2>
Hi, I’m Eli and I’m a game design generalist with skills in programming, design, research and sound. My goal is to make games that are as unique as they are interesting. Games are more interesting when they have vision and voice behind them, so I hope to make games that I’m the most uniquely situated to make.

If you’d like to see my ability to design clever puzzles and compose music, I would check out [Homerun Miko](/projects/homerun-miko). It was my senior capstone game for UC Santa Cruz and I guarantee you’ll find the puzzles interesting and unique, with plenty of “aha!” moments to be had.

If you want to see my programming ability I would take a look at [Choke Slam](/projects/choke-slam). It’s a one on one fighting game made in the Godot engine, designed and mostly programmed by me. While it may look simple on the surface, dialing in fighting game mechanics to have both depth and game feel is quite the challenge. It requires a second player, but if you get the chance you'll find it's quite fun and has a good amount of depth for it's constrained rule set.

If you’re curious what I mean by research I would take a look at [Harmony Train](/projects/harmony-train). It’s quite the hard game to wrap your head around, but the general idea is to make music into a card game. You can play cards from your hand to create chord sequences, and then the game scores you based on its own chord progression algorithm. It’s certainly not to everyone’s taste, but in making and play testing it I learned a lot about how we learn when interacting with a game.

## Projects:
