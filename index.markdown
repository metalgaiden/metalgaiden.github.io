<h2> About me: </h2>
I am a game designer and programmer with a B.S. in
Computer Science: Game Design at University of California Santa Cruz
who likes video games, rock climbing, martial arts (judo, bjj), and tinkering with old electronics.

I've played a wide variety of games across many genres and have a good understanding of what makes most of them tick.
My favorite games are fighting games, but I also play rogue-likes/lites, simulation games, platformers, strategy games, puzzle games, tabletop games and many more.

## What I'm looking for:
I'm hoping to work on games that meaningfully push gaming as a medium forward,
which can mean a number of things to different people so I'll be a little more specific.

I think there are two ways to make a game that pushes the boundaries.
The first is to add elements into games that have not been there before.
This approach takes elements from other disciplines or personal experience and injects them into games,
pulling new and unique elements into the gaming experience.
An example of this is Disco Elysium, which takes elements from politics, philosophy and psychology in addition
to it's more conventional rpg roots.

A subset of these kinds of games are one's that pull directly from other games, but recombine the base elements
into something new.
Noita does a great job of this, taking pieces from older simulation games like powder-toy and combining them with the core loop of a modern rogue-lite.

The second approach is to explore the internal mechanics of games themselves, and present a more direct and authentic narrative about the constraints the medium imposes. Games like The Witness or Undertale do a great job of this, asking the player to understand the games on a more fundamental level in order to see all it has to offer.

If you think you have an opportunity doing anything like I listed above please get in touch.
