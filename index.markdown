<h2> About me: </h2>
I am a game designer and programmer with a B.S. in Computer Science: Game Design at University of California Santa Cruz. I like video games of course, but also rock climbing, martial arts (judo, bjj), and philosophy.

I try to play a wide variety of games across different genres to better understand what makes a game engaging and worth playing. My favorite games are fighting games, puzzle games, and rogue-lites, but anything that I feel I can get something out of is worth playing in my eyes.

## My Design Philosophy
If fiction is about stories, then fiction writers need to be good storytellers. Similarly non-fiction, which is about facts or ideas, requires a combination of research and rhetorical skill. Games are about actions, and as such the primary aim of good design is in the art of suggestion.

Sometimes this means making it abundantly clear what the player should do or feel, other times it means withholding a correct answer to allow the player to find it themselves. Either way suggestion is the primary tool in a good game designer's tool belt.

I also believe strongly that designers have a responsibility to explore the possible space of game designs, and always try new ideas the push at the boundaries of what already exists. This doesn't mean they should make bad games on purpose, just that the best ideas sit somewhere between where we are and where we could be.

My primary interests in games are those that leave the player with more than they came in with, whether it's educational, skill mastery, or a story to tell their friends. My linkedin, github and email are linked below and my resume can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).
