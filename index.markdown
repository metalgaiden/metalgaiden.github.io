<h2> About me: </h2>
I am a game designer and programmer with a B.S. in Computer Science: Game Design at University of California Santa Cruz. I like video games, as you might expect, but I also enjoy rock climbing, martial arts (judo, bjj), and analytic philosophy.

I try to play a wide variety of games across different genres to better understand what makes a game engaging and worth playing. I enjoy fighting games, puzzle games and rogue-lites, but genre is usually not the main determinant for my level of interest in a game. I'm looking mostly for games that challenge my assumptions and theories about what games are and should be, as I believe that makes my assessment of games more grounded and informed.

## My Design Philosophy
If fiction is about stories, then fiction writers need to be good storytellers. Similarly non-fiction, which is about facts or ideas, requires a combination of research and rhetorical skill. Games are about actions, and as such the primary aim of good design is in the art of suggestion.

Sometimes this means making it abundantly clear what the player should do or feel, other times it means withholding a correct answer to allow the player to find it themselves. Either way, suggestion is the primary tool in a good game designer's tool belt.

I also believe strongly that designers have a responsibility to explore the possible space of game designs. They should try new ideas that push at the boundaries of what already exists. This doesn't mean designers should make bad games on purpose, just that the best ideas sit somewhere between where we are and where we could be.

My primary interest in games is in the way they interact with the player. Specifically how the player forms a mental model of the game in their head, and how the game plays with and responds to this model. My linkedin, github and email are linked below and my resume can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).
